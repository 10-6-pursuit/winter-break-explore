# Winter Break Explore

## Instructions

* Create a replit and write your solutions there. By the end of the winter break or once you finish all the exercises send the link for the replit to your instructors
* To test your functions, you'll need to come up with your examples. Think about different scenarios and input values that will help you verify that your functions work correctly. Feel free to experiment and explore!
* You can also paste your solution in chatGPT and ask it to generate examples for you!
* You will probably need to do some research to understand how to use certain methods but you got it!
